    \section{Project 3: Visualizing Movie
Data}\label{project-3-visualizing-movie-data}

    \subsection{Introduction:}\label{introduction}

A new movie production company looking to make a new movie and wants to
make sure it's a success. As a result, the movie company wants to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How have movie genres changed over time?
\item
  How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount
  Pictures?
\item
  How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based
  on novels?
\item
  An additional open-ended question determined from the data
  exploration.
\end{enumerate}

To determine these answers, The Movie Database was used. The Movie
Database is a publicly available database that provides information on
thousands of movies, such as title, cast, director, budget, revenue,
genre(s), release date, and various popularity metrics.

Data visualizations associated with each answer can be found here.

    \subsection{Question 1: How have movie genres changed over
time?}\label{question-1-how-have-movie-genres-changed-over-time}

The total number of movies for each genre, except for Westerns, has
increased since 1960, and has especially increased since 2000. Drama,
Comedy, Action, and Horror movies have consistently been the four genres
with the most movies produced between 1960 and 2015. Recently, Thriller
and Documentary movies have substantially increased and in 2015, were
the genres with the fourth and fifth most movies produced.

    \subsection{Question 2: How do the attributes differ between Universal
Pictures and Paramount
Pictures?}\label{question-2-how-do-the-attributes-differ-between-universal-pictures-and-paramount-pictures}

The number of movies produced, average runtime per movie, average viewer
vote, average budget per movie, and average revenue per movie for
Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures produced films have
historically been very similar. The list below describes the recent
differences for each of these attributes: - Number of movies produced:
Universal Pictures produces 5 more movies per year. - Average Runtime:
The average runtimes vary between 100 and 120 minutes, with negligible
differences between production companies. - Vote Average: The average
viewer vote remains around 6.3/10, with negligible differences between
production companies. - Average Budget: Paramount Pictures tends to
outspend Universal Pictures by approximately \$5 million per movie. -
Average Revenue: Paramount Pictures tends to out-earn Universal
Pictures, often by more than \$50 million per movie.

    \subsection{Question 3: How have movies based on novels performed
relative to movies not based on
novels?}\label{question-3-how-have-movies-based-on-novels-performed-relative-to-movies-not-based-on-novels}

Movies based on novels have been produced at much lower rates than
movies not based on novels between 1960 and 2015. The list below
describes the recent differences for average runtime, average viewer
vote, average budget per movie, and average revenue per movie: - Average
Runtime: The average runtimes of movies based on novels are consistently
larger than those of movies not based on novels, and were approximately
20 minutes longer in 2015. - Vote Average: The average viewer vote of
movies based on novels have historically been slightly higher than
movies not based on novels, and were only 0.3 ahead in 2015. - Average
Budget: Movies based on novels historically outspend movies not based on
novels pretty significantly, and were approximately \$20 million more in
2015. - Average Revenue: Movies based on novels historically outear
movies not based on novels very significantly, and were approximately
\$100 million more in 2015.

    \subsection{Question 4: What are the attributes of recent movies with
low budgets and high
revenues?}\label{question-4-what-are-the-attributes-of-recent-movies-with-low-budgets-and-high-revenues}

Recent low budget high revenue movies, or movies since 1990 with a
budget less than \$50M and a revenue greater than \$200M, are close to
15 minutes longer, slightly more popular, and are mostly Comedy, Drama,
or Action movies.
